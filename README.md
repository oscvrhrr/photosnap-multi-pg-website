This is a [front end mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) challenge, front end mentor is a website that provides
design files for front end developers to practice real life workflows.

My goal for this project was to learn CSS Grid, I have now developed muscle memory writing CSS and
confident to build out UI with CSS quickly.

the SrcSet attribute to make an image responsive.
